                        If you're drawn to places where echoes of ancient civilisations resonate down through the ages, <strong>Iran</strong> could be your thing.<br> Some of history's biggest names<em>– Cyrus and Darius, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan –</em>                        all left their mark here and the cities they conquered or over which they ruled are among the finest in a region rich with such storied ruins. <br>Walking around the awesome power and beauty of <em>Persepolis</em>, experiencing
                        the remote power of <em>Susa (Shush)</em> , and taking in the wonderfully immense <em> Elamite</em> ziggurat at <em>Choqa Zanbil</em> will carry you all the way back to the glory days of Ancient Persia.
